# Before-Coding-Test
It will contain which instructions to strictly follow before giving any coding test.

01. Time Management of all questions according to their marking.
    1. Ex. Q1-15 Marks, Q2-10 Marks, Q3-5 Marks, Total Time- 60 minutes
    2. 15x+10x+5x=60
    3. 30x=60
    4. x=2
    5. Q1=30 min, Q2=20 min, Q3=10 min
02. Read the problem statement carefully and don't rush.
03. If any company is giving TLE then understand the constraints.
04. If failing testcases then debug code smartly.
    1. Give Custom input and dry run your code. //if no logical error go to next step
    2. write the print statements on parts of your code //first divide code in big parts and then start narrow down the part of error
    3. Stub function
    4. If runtime error then comment part of code and try to find due to which part of code I am getting that runtime error.//if we comment some part and after that we didnot get any runtime error then in that part runtime error exist.
